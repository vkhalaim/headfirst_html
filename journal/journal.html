        Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!

            Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
            through some interesting places on the way:
            <ol>
                <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
                <li>Magic City, ID</li>
                <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
                <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
                <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
                <li>Why, AZ</li>
            </ol>
    </p>

        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
        road today:
        <blockquote>
            Passing cars, <br>
            When you can't see, <br>
            May get you, <br>
            A glimpse, <br>
            Of eternity. <br>
        </blockquote>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.

        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
        everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on <em> a Segway</em>,
        I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
        <ul>
            <li>cell phone</li>
            <li>iPod</li>
            <li>digital camera</li>
            <li>a protein bar</li>
        </ul>
        Just the essentials. As
        Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins
        with one Segway. </q>
